# Phase 1: Basic Adaptive Network Implementation

This phase implements the foundational components of our adaptive network system, focusing on basic arithmetic and geometric operations.

## Components

### Models

  - Geometric operations training
  - Multiplier network training

## Experiment Results

The experiments are organized into three main categories:

1. **Arithmetic Training**
   - Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction)
   - Results logged in `experiments/results/logs/arithmetic_training.jsonl`
   - Performance metrics and convergence analysis

2. **Geometric Training**
   - Basic geometric operations
   - Results logged in `experiments/results/logs/geometric_training.jsonl`
   - Spatial reasoning capabilities

3. **Multiplier Training**
   - Advanced multiplication operations
   - Results logged in `experiments/results/logs/multiplier_training.jsonl`
   - Scaling and performance analysis

## Model Architecture

The adaptive network architecture in this phase includes:
- Input layer with dynamic scaling
- Hidden layers with adaptive weights
- Output layer with result verification
- Feedback mechanisms for continuous learning

## Training Process
